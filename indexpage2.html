		<div class="introtext">
			<p>To Whom It May Concern : <br/> <br/>I'm Hugo, currently enrolled in the MSC Digital Marketing and Sales at Kedge Business School, in France. <br/> <br/> Just like a crowd of other students, I need to complete a final internship to obtain my degree. This is the reason why you received my application. But the reason I made all of this (i.e. this small website), is that I want you to have a better insight on who I am. <br/> To me, marketing is an extremely powerful tool, and I am convinced it can help achieving many great things of all kind. <br/> Thus, I now want to learn more and more about how to use it, in all its aspect, including its digital ones, in order to improve my skills and become as likely as I can to be successful in all my works thanks to it.<br/><br/> 
			That is why I am deeply interested to work for a company that has a deep knowledge of marketing strategy and its digital forms, so I could experience and learn from the most skilled in the field.<br/><br/> 

			Thus, I encourage you to browse through this website, explore it, and you may see it as my personal portfolio.</p>
